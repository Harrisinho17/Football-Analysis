- Creating a workflow diagram 

## **Overview and Background** 
This project leverages machine learning, computer vision, and deep learning to develop a football analysis system. By utilizing YOLO for detecting players, referees, and footballs, and employing K-means for sophisticated pixel segmentation and clustering, our system assigns players to teams based on their jersey colors. We also incorporate optical flow to accurately gauge camera movements and apply perspective transformations to depict the true depth and perspective of the playing field. This enables the extraction of vital game metrics such as player speeds, possession percentages, and the distances covered by teams.

Developed as a collaborative effort between my friend and myself, both of us avid football players with a strong interest in analytics, this project represents a fusion of our passion for the sport and technology. The inspiration for this endeavor came from Code in a Jiffyâ€™s tutorial, which we adapted and expanded upon. Posted 8 months ago on their YouTube channel, this project not only showcases our technical capabilities but also our initiative in leveraging digital innovations to enhance the understanding and appreciation of football.
